Once upon a time, in a field not too far from you, there was an energetic and happy hare and a sleepy tortoise.

The happy hare was called silver and the sleepy tortoise was called Spencer. Sir the tortoise liked to sit and munch his dinner slowly, whilst spear the hare would gobble up his dinner and run round and round Spencer until he was dizzy.
Noel the hare looked very unhappy and sulky. Archibald the tortoise felt sorry for him and tried to cheer him up.
